# JMS ActiveMQ

There are two projects: one for the sender and one for the receiver. You have to run those programs separately. First run the sender and send a message. Then, run the receiver and receive a message.

See the README files in their corresponding project directories.

[Sender](jms-activemq-sender)
[Receiver](jms-activemq-receiver)

## FYI

* ActiveMQ Admin Page - http://localhost:8161/admin/
* This example was based on a [tutorial by CoderPanda](http://www.coderpanda.com/jms-example-using-apache-activemq/)
* The projects use Maven as the build system
